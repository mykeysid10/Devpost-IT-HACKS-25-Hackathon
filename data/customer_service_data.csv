Let me help you with our International Roaming Pack which offers 5GB data, unlimited calls and 100 SMS for $15 for 7 days. I can also refund 50% of the unexpected charges as a goodwill gesture.

I recommend our Premium Plan which offers 100GB data, unlimited calls, free streaming subscriptions, and international roaming benefits for $60/month.

Would you like me to set up data usage notifications for you?"
9,billing_issues,Why was I charged an extra $10 this month?,negative,"I see the $10 charge is for our new Value-Added Services package that was automatically added. I apologize for any confusion - let me remove this charge immediately and refund the amount. To prevent similar issues, I've disabled auto-addition of new services to your account. You'll see the refund in your next billing statement. Is there anything else I can clarify about your bill?"
10,network_coverage,The network speed in my office is very slow,negative,"I understand slow speeds can be frustrating, especially during work hours. Let me check your area - I see there's a network optimization scheduled for tomorrow that should improve speeds. Meanwhile, I recommend connecting to WiFi for data-intensive tasks. I can also provide a mini signal booster for your office at no cost for 30 days. Would you like me to arrange the signal booster for you?"
11,international_roaming,What are the roaming rates for Europe?,neutral,"For Europe, we offer three roaming packages: Basic ($10 for 2GB data, 100 mins), Standard ($20 for 5GB data, unlimited calls), and Premium ($30 for 10GB data, unlimited calls + SMS).

12,plan_upgrade,Is it worth upgrading from my current 20GB plan?,neutral,"Based on your usage patterns, you typically use 18-22GB monthly, which is very close to your limit. Upgrading to our 40GB plan for $15 more would prevent speed throttling and give you breathing room. You'd also get free access to our music streaming service.

13,device_support,How do I enable WiFi calling on my iPhone?,neutral,"To enable WiFi calling: Go to Settings > Phone > WiFi Calling, then toggle 'WiFi Calling on This iPhone'.

15,data_usage,I received a data usage alert but I wasn't using my phone,negative,I understand your concern about unexpected data usage.

18,international_roaming,Can I use my current data package while traveling to Canada?,neutral,"For Canada, your domestic data package doesn't apply. However, we have special North America Roaming packs starting at $10 for 3GB data valid for 7 days. The pack includes calls and texts to US/Canada numbers. I recommend activating it before you travel through our mobile app. Would you like me to send you the detailed package options via email?"
19,plan_upgrade,My current plan is too expensive for what I use,negative,"I understand your concern about getting value for money. Based on your usage of 8GB data and minimal calling, I recommend switching to our Basic Plan at $25/month which includes 15GB data and unlimited calls. This would save you $20 monthly while meeting your needs. The switch is immediate with pro-rated billing. Shall I help you downgrade to this more suitable plan?"
20,device_support,My phone says 'No Service' even after restarting,negative,"I apologize for the service disruption. Let's try a network settings reset which often resolves this issue.

22,data_usage,Why is my data speed so slow after I reached my limit?,neutral,"When you reach your monthly data limit, your speeds are reduced to 512Kbps for basic browsing and emails.

Would you like me to check coverage for your specific rural location?"
25,international_roaming,My phone connected to a foreign network but I can't make calls,negative,"I understand the frustration of being unable to connect while abroad. This usually happens when manual network selection is needed. Go to Settings > Mobile Networks > Network Operators and select 'Auto Select'. If that doesn't work, restart your phone overseas. I can also check if international roaming is fully activated on your account. Would you like me to verify your roaming status?"
26,plan_upgrade,What benefits will I get if I upgrade to family plan?,neutral,"Our Family Plan offers 200GB shared data, 4 included lines, individual data limits, parental controls, and location tracking features.

Would you like me to guide you through the process?"
30,billing_issues,Why did my monthly bill increase by $5 this month?,negative,"I see the increase is due to the annual regulatory cost recovery fee adjustment that affects all customers.

I'm also checking if you qualify for any loyalty discounts that could reduce your overall monthly cost. Let me process that credit for you now."

33,plan_upgrade,I'm paying too much for features I don't use,negative,"I understand wanting to pay only for what you need. Based on your usage, you're only using 30% of your data and none of the premium features.

34,device_support,My phone gets very hot during video calls,negative,"Phone heating during video calls is common but concerning.

38,network_coverage,Why does my phone show 5G but internet is slow?,negative,"This can happen during network congestion or when you're connected to 5G but with weak signal strength. I recommend toggling airplane mode on/off to reconnect to a better tower. I'm also reporting this to our network team for investigation. As compensation for the poor experience, I'm adding 5GB of bonus data to your account."
39,international_roaming,Can I use my phone as a hotspot while roaming?,neutral,"Yes, but hotspot usage while roaming consumes from your roaming data package and may have speed restrictions. Our Premium Roaming package includes dedicated hotspot data at full speed. I recommend checking your specific roaming package details in our app. Would you like me to check if your current package includes hotspot usage?"
40,plan_upgrade,What's the difference between 4G and 5G plans?,neutral,"The main difference is speed and latency. 5G plans offer speeds up to 1Gbps vs 100Mbps on 4G, with much lower latency for gaming/video calls. However, both use the same data allowances. 5G requires a compatible device and coverage. I can check if your device supports 5G and if it's available in your area. Would you like me to verify this?"
41,device_support,How do I backup my contacts before changing phones?,neutral,You can backup contacts through our cloud service in the phone settings or export them to your email.

Would you like me to activate it for this weekend?
44,billing_issues,My payment failed but I have sufficient funds,negative,I apologize for the payment issue. This can happen due to bank security checks or temporary system errors. Let me retry the payment and waive any late fees. I also recommend adding a backup payment method to avoid service interruptions. The payment should process successfully now. Would you like to add a backup card?
45,network_coverage,Will my phone work in mountainous areas during hiking?,neutral,"Coverage in mountainous areas can be spotty due to terrain. I recommend downloading offline maps and important contacts beforehand. Our coverage map shows which hiking trails have service. For emergency situations, your phone should connect to any available network. Would you like me to check coverage for your specific hiking location?"
46,international_roaming,How do I avoid bill shock when traveling internationally?,neutral,To avoid bill shock: 1) Purchase a roaming package before travel 2) Disable data roaming when not needed 3) Use WiFi for data-intensive tasks 4) Download maps and content beforehand 5) Set up spending alerts in our app. I can help you set all these precautions.

Our Unlimited Premium plan offers truly unlimited high-speed data, 100GB mobile hotspot, and 4K streaming for $80/month. This includes all premium features with no speed restrictions ever. The plan also includes international roaming benefits. Would you like me to proceed with this upgrade effective immediately?"
48,device_support,My battery drains too fast after the latest update,negative,"This is a known issue with the recent update. I recommend resetting settings (Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings) which often resolves battery drain without deleting data. Also, check battery usage by app and close background apps. If it persists, we can run remote diagnostics. Shall I guide you through the reset process?"
49,customer_service,The agent promised a callback but never called,negative,"I sincerely apologize for this broken promise. This is unacceptable and I'm escalating this to our quality team. As immediate compensation, I'm applying a $20 credit to your account. I'll personally ensure your issue gets resolved now. What was the original issue you needed help with?"
50,data_usage,Can I roll over unused data to next month?,neutral,Yes! Our Data Rollover feature automatically carries forward up to 50GB of unused data to the next month.

You can track your rolled-over data in our mobile app. Is there anything else about data rollover you'd like to know?
51,billing_issues,Why am I being charged for paper bills?,negative,"I apologize for the confusion. The $2 paper bill fee applies when you choose physical bills over electronic statements. Let me switch you to paperless billing immediately and remove this charge. You'll receive email statements instead, which are more eco-friendly too. I'm also refunding the last 3 months of paper bill fees. The changes are effective immediately."

As compensation, I'm adding 3GB of data to your account. Would you like help changing your network settings?"
53,international_roaming,Do you have packages for cruise ship connectivity?,neutral,"Yes, we have cruise-specific packages starting at $25 for 100MB data and 30 minutes of calls. However, cruise ship connectivity can be expensive and limited. I recommend using port WiFi when available and purchasing smaller packages to manage costs. Would you like me to send you the detailed cruise package options?"
54,plan_upgrade,"I'm a student, do you offer any discounts?",positive,Yes! We have a Student Advantage program offering 20% discount on all plans with verified student email.

56,customer_service,The store was closed during posted business hours,negative,"I apologize for this inconvenience. This is unacceptable and I'm reporting this to the area manager immediately.

What assistance do you need?"
57,data_usage,My data speed is fine but video calls keep freezing,negative,"Video call freezing is often due to network instability rather than speed. I recommend using WiFi for important video calls or enabling 'Video Call Optimization' in network settings. I'm also running a line quality test on your connection. As a temporary solution, I'm boosting your network priority for the next 48 hours. This should improve your video call quality significantly."
58,billing_issues,The payment due date doesn't work for my pay schedule,neutral,I can easily change your billing date to better align with your pay schedule. You can choose any date between 1st-28th of the month. The change takes effect from next billing cycle with pro-rated adjustment. What would be your preferred billing date? I can make that change for you right now.
59,network_coverage,Will weather conditions affect my signal strength?,neutral,"Severe weather like heavy rain or storms can temporarily affect signal strength, but normal weather has minimal impact. Our network is designed to withstand most weather conditions. If you're experiencing consistent weather-related issues, there might be a local tower problem. Would you like me to check for any network advisories in your area?"
60,international_roaming,Can I use my domestic calling minutes internationally?,neutral,"Your domestic calling minutes only apply within the country.

Would you like me to check which package works best for your calling needs?"
61,plan_upgrade,What happens if I exceed my data limit?,neutral,"When you exceed your data limit, your speeds reduce to 512Kbps for basic browsing, but you won't be charged overage fees. You can purchase Data Boost packs to restore high-speed data, or wait until your next billing cycle. I recommend setting up data usage alerts to avoid unexpected speed reductions. Would you like me to help set these alerts?"
62,device_support,How do I set up call forwarding to another number?,neutral,"To set up call forwarding: Dial *72 + destination number + #. To disable, dial *73#.

As compensation, I'm adding 2GB of data to your account."
67,international_roaming,Do I need to unlock my phone for international use?,neutral,"If your phone was purchased from us, it's already unlocked for international use.

71,data_usage,How accurate is the data usage meter in the app?,neutral,"Our data usage meter is 98% accurate and updates every 4 hours.

80,network_coverage,Will 5G drain my battery faster than 4G?,neutral,"5G can use 10-20% more battery than 4G when actively transferring data, but modern phones optimize this well.

Would you like tips to optimize your battery life with 5G?"
81,international_roaming,How do I know which network to connect to abroad?,neutral,"Your phone should automatically connect to the best available partner network.

83,device_support,My phone won't send pictures via text message,negative,"This is usually due to MMS settings or data issues. First, ensure cellular data is enabled as MMS requires data. Then check MMS settings are correct. I can push the correct APN settings to your device remotely. This typically resolves MMS issues immediately. Would you like me to send the configuration update to your phone now?"
84,customer_service,The installation was completed ahead of schedule,positive,"That's fantastic! We aim to complete installations efficiently while maintaining quality. Thank you for acknowledging our team's punctuality. I'll share this positive feedback with the installation team manager. As our appreciation, I'm adding a complimentary month of our premium technical support to your account. Is everything working perfectly?"

86,billing_issues,Why am I being taxed for services I don't use?,negative,"Telecom taxes are government-mandated and apply to all active lines regardless of usage. However, I can review your account for any service-specific fees that can be removed. I see a $3 'Premium Content' fee that I'm removing immediately. The tax portion cannot be altered as it's regulatory. The $3 removal is effective immediately."
87,network_coverage,The network icon shows 'R' instead of 4G/5G,negative,"'R' indicates you're roaming on another carrier's network, which shouldn't happen in your home area. This suggests a temporary network issue. I recommend toggling airplane mode to reconnect to our network. I'm also reporting this to our network team. As compensation, I'm adding 3GB of data to your account. Please let me know if the issue persists after restart."
88,international_roaming,Can I use WhatsApp calling while roaming without charges?,neutral,"WhatsApp calls use data, so they'll consume from your roaming data package. Voice calls are very data-efficient (about 0.5MB per minute). I recommend using WhatsApp calling over WiFi when available to save roaming data. Would you like me to calculate how many WhatsApp calling minutes your roaming package would provide?"
89,plan_upgrade,What happens to my current plan if I upgrade mid-cycle?,neutral,"When you upgrade mid-cycle, the new plan takes effect immediately with pro-rated charges. You'll pay for the remaining days of your old plan and the new plan starts fresh. Any unused data from your old plan is forfeited, but you get the full new data allowance immediately. Would you like me to calculate the exact pro-rated charges for you?"
90,device_support,How do I set up emergency SOS on my phone?,neutral,For iPhone: Quickly press side button 5 times. For Android: Press power button 3-5 times (varies by model).

91,customer_service,The store didn't have the phone model I wanted in stock,negative,"I apologize for the inventory issue. Let me check availability at nearby stores and arrange a transfer, or I can order it for home delivery with free shipping. I'm also applying a $25 accessory credit for the inconvenience. Would you prefer to pick it up from another store or have it delivered to your home?"
92,data_usage,Why does my data usage show differently on different devices?,neutral,"This happens because each device has its own data counter, while our system shows network-side usage. Network usage is more accurate as it includes overhead. The difference is usually 5-10%. I recommend relying on our app data for billing purposes. Would you like me to help you sync your device counters with our network data?"
93,billing_issues,I was promised a discount that never appeared,negative,I apologize for this broken promise. Let me check the promotion notes and apply the discount immediately. I see the $15 monthly discount for 12 months was approved but not activated. I'm activating it now and backdating it for 3 months with credits. The discount will now appear on every bill. I'm adding a $10 goodwill credit for this error.
94,network_coverage,Does 5G work inside buildings and elevators?,neutral,"5G signals can penetrate buildings but may be weaker than 4G in some materials. Elevators typically have the weakest signal due to metal construction. For consistent indoor coverage, I recommend WiFi calling. Most modern buildings have adequate 5G coverage, but it varies by construction. Would you like to check 5G coverage for your specific building?"
95,international_roaming,Can I pause my service while traveling long-term?,positive,"Yes! Our Service Pause feature lets you suspend service for 3-6 months while keeping your number, for $10/month.

97,device_support,How do I clear my phone's cache to improve performance?,neutral,For Android: Settings > Storage > Cached Data > Clear. For iPhone: Offload unused apps or restart device.

I'll share your comments with our web development team. As our appreciation, I'm adding 5GB of bonus data to your account this month.

You can set this up in our app under 'Data Controls > App Limits'. Would you like me to guide you through setting app-specific data limits?
100,billing_issues,Why is there an 'administrative fee' on my bill?,negative,"The $2.50 administrative fee helps cover regulatory compliance costs and billing system maintenance. While this is a standard industry fee, I can offset it by applying a $5 credit to your account this month. I'm also checking if you qualify for any fee waivers based on your payment history. The credit is processed immediately."
101,network_coverage,The network shows full bars but internet doesn't work,negative,"This indicates a data network issue despite good voice signal. I recommend restarting your device and checking APN settings. I'm also running a data network diagnostic on your line. As compensation, I'm adding 5GB of data to your account. Please try restarting your phone - this often resolves temporary data connection issues."
102,international_roaming,Do you have packages for business travelers?,neutral,"Yes! Our Business Traveler package offers 10GB data, unlimited calls to 50 countries, and premium support for $50 for 14 days. This includes dedicated business support and faster network priority.

Thank you for your kind words!"
106,data_usage,Why does speed test show different results than actual usage?,neutral,"Speed tests measure maximum potential speed to a specific server, while actual usage depends on the website/app server, network congestion, and your device capability. The speed test result is your network capacity, not guaranteed speed for all activities. Would you like me to run a more comprehensive network quality test on your connection?"
107,billing_issues,I was double-charged for the same service,negative,I apologize for this billing error. I see duplicate charges for the premium package this month. Let me remove one charge immediately and process a refund. I'm also implementing a system check to prevent recurrence. The refund will process in 3-5 business days. I'm adding a $10 credit for this error.
108,network_coverage,Does network performance vary by time of day?,neutral,"Yes, network performance can vary during peak hours (7-10 AM and 5-9 PM) when more people are using the network. However, our network is designed to handle peak loads with minimal impact. If you're experiencing significant slowdowns, there might be local network work. Would you like me to check your area's network status?"
109,international_roaming,Can I use my domestic data package in neighboring countries?,neutral,"Your domestic data package only works within the country. For neighboring countries, you need specific regional roaming packages. We have North America, European, and Asia-Pacific packages at competitive rates. Would you like me to check which regional package covers your travel destinations?"
110,plan_upgrade,What happens to my promotional rate after 12 months?,neutral,"After 12 months, your plan reverts to the standard monthly rate. However, we always have new promotions available, and I can help you switch to another promotional plan before your current one ends. I'll set a reminder to contact you 30 days before your promotion ends with the best available options. Sound good?"
111,device_support,How do I enable dark mode on my device?,neutral,For iPhone: Settings > Display & Brightness > Dark. For Android: Settings > Display > Dark Theme.

113,data_usage,Can I get a refund for unused data?,neutral,"Unfortunately, unused data doesn't qualify for refunds as it's part of your monthly service package. However, our Data Rollover feature carries forward unused data to the next month (up to 50GB). I can help you enable data rollover if it's not active. Would you like me to check if data rollover is enabled on your account?"
114,billing_issues,The paper bill is difficult to read and understand,negative,I apologize for the clarity issues with your paper bill. Let me switch you to our simplified e-bill format which is easier to read and includes interactive explanations. I'm also applying a $5 credit for the inconvenience. The e-bills are more environmentally friendly too. The change takes effect immediately.
115,network_coverage,Why does my phone show 'SOS only' in some areas?,negative,"'SOS only' means you can only make emergency calls because no carrier network is available. This happens in remote areas or buildings with no coverage. I recommend checking our coverage map before travel and downloading offline maps. As compensation, I'm adding 5GB of data to your account. Would you like help checking coverage for your frequent locations?"
116,international_roaming,Can I use mobile payment apps while roaming?,neutral,"Yes, mobile payment apps work while roaming as they use minimal data. However, ensure you have sufficient roaming data balance. I recommend setting up payment apps before travel and testing them. For security, use WiFi for payment app updates when possible. Would you like me to check if your roaming package includes sufficient data for payment apps?"
117,plan_upgrade,I want to combine my family's individual plans,positive,"Excellent idea! Combining plans can save you 20-30% compared to individual plans. Our Family Plan includes shared data, individual usage tracking, and parental controls. I can help you merge all lines with pro-rated adjustments. The process takes 24-48 hours.

Our email team takes pride in providing comprehensive solutions. I'll share your positive feedback with them. As our appreciation, I'm adding a complimentary month of our email security service to your account. Is there anything else you need assistance with?"
120,data_usage,Why does streaming video use so much data compared to music?,neutral,Video streaming uses 10-15 times more data than music because video files are much larger. HD video uses 1-3GB per hour vs 50-150MB for music. I recommend lowering video quality on cellular and downloading content on WiFi. Would you like help setting data-friendly streaming quality on your apps?
121,billing_issues,I was charged for a service I cancelled months ago,negative,I apologize for this error. I see the 'Premium Backup' service was cancelled but charges continued. Let me stop the charges immediately and process a full refund for the last 4 months. I'm also implementing additional safeguards. The refund of $32 will process in 3-5 business days. I'm adding a $10 goodwill credit.
122,network_coverage,Does using VPN affect my network speed?,neutral,"Yes, VPNs can reduce speed by 10-40% due to encryption overhead and server distance. However, they provide security and privacy benefits. For best speed, choose nearby VPN servers and use reputable VPN providers. Would you like recommendations for VPN services that work well with our network?"
123,international_roaming,Can I receive texts while roaming without charges?,neutral,"Yes, receiving texts is typically free while roaming. Sending texts may incur charges depending on your roaming package. iMessage and WhatsApp use data, so they consume from your roaming data package. Would you like me to verify the specific text messaging costs for your destination country?"
124,plan_upgrade,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid?,neutral,"Prepaid: Pay upfront, no credit check, no bill, service stops if balance expires.

Would you like me to compare which option works better for your needs?"
125,device_support,How do I take a screenshot on my new phone?,neutral,For most phones: Press Power + Volume Down simultaneously. For Samsung: Palm swipe gesture.

128,billing_issues,The payment I made isn't showing on my account,negative,I apologize for the delay in payment processing. Let me check the payment system immediately. I see the payment was received but stuck in verification. I'm manually approving it now and waiving any late fees. The payment should reflect immediately. I'm also applying a $5 credit for the inconvenience.
129,network_coverage,Why does my phone show 4G instead of 5G in 5G areas?,negative,"This can happen if your phone is in battery saver mode, network settings need updating, or there's temporary network optimization. I recommend updating carrier settings and ensuring 5G is enabled. I'm also checking your area's 5G status. As compensation, I'm adding 3GB of data to your account. Please try updating your carrier settings."
130,international_roaming,Can I use my phone as a GPS while roaming?,neutral,"Yes, but GPS navigation apps use significant data for maps and traffic. I recommend downloading offline maps before travel to save roaming data. Google Maps and Apple Maps both offer offline map downloads. Would you like instructions for downloading offline maps for your destination?"
131,plan_upgrade,I want a plan with unlimited hotspot data,positive,"Our Unlimited Premium plan includes 100GB of high-speed hotspot data, after which speeds reduce to 3Mbps - still sufficient for most uses.

132,device_support,How do I check for software updates?,neutral,For iPhone: Settings > General > Software Update. For Android: Settings > System > System Update.

134,data_usage,Why does background app refresh use so much data?,neutral,"Background app refresh keeps apps updated with new content, which can use significant data over time. I recommend disabling background refresh for non-essential apps and enabling 'Low Data Mode' in settings. This can reduce background data usage by up to 70%. Would you like help optimizing your background app settings?"
135,billing_issues,The promotional price ended without warning,negative,"I apologize for the lack of notification. Promotional terms are in your service agreement, but we should have sent a reminder. Let me check if you qualify for a new promotion. I see a loyalty promotion that gives you the same discount for another 6 months. I'm applying it immediately and backdating it with a credit. I'm also adding a $10 goodwill credit."
136,network_coverage,Does weather affect 5G signal more than 4G?,neutral,"5G can be slightly more affected by heavy rain due to higher frequency signals, but the difference is minimal for most users. Both 4G and 5G networks are designed to withstand normal weather conditions. Severe weather might cause temporary issues with any wireless service. Would you like to report a specific weather-related issue you're experiencing?"
137,international_roaming,Can I purchase roaming data at the airport upon arrival?,neutral,"Yes, but airport purchases are typically more expensive. I recommend purchasing through our app before travel for the best rates. You can activate roaming packages up to 30 days before travel. They automatically activate when you reach your destination. Would you like me to help you purchase a roaming package now for your upcoming trip?"
138,plan_upgrade,What's the process for switching from another carrier?,positive,"Switching is easy! First, don't cancel your current service.

139,device_support,How do I set up voice commands on my phone?,neutral,For iPhone: Settings > Siri & Search > Enable 'Listen for Hey Siri'. For Android: Google app > Settings > Voice > Voice Match.

142,billing_issues,The bill due date falls on a weekend/holiday,neutral,"If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, payment is due the next business day without late fees. However, I can change your due date to a more convenient day if you prefer. You can choose any date between 1st-28th. Would you like me to change your billing due date?"
143,network_coverage,Why does my phone show different network technologies in different areas?,neutral,"Your phone automatically connects to the best available network technology (5G, 4G, 3G) based on signal strength and network optimization. This ensures the best possible service in each location. 5G is preferred where available, then 4G, then 3G as backup. This automatic switching is normal and ensures continuous service."
144,international_roaming,Can I use my domestic voice minutes for international calls?,neutral,"Your domestic voice minutes only apply to calls within the country. For international calls, you need international calling credits or specific international packages. We have packages starting at $10 for 100 minutes to popular countries. Would you like me to check which international calling package works best for your needs?"
145,plan_upgrade,What happens to my device installment if I upgrade early?,neutral,"If you upgrade early, the remaining device balance becomes due immediately.

Would you like me to check your early upgrade options and costs?"
146,device_support,How do I enable battery percentage display?,neutral,For iPhone: Settings > Battery > Battery Percentage. For Android: Settings > Battery > Battery Percentage (or check Status Bar settings). Showing battery percentage helps monitor exact battery level.

As our appreciation, I'm adding 3GB of bonus data to your account. Is there any other setup you need help with?"
148,data_usage,Why does my data speed vary throughout the day?,neutral,"Data speeds vary due to network congestion during peak hours (7-10 AM, 5-9 PM), network optimization, and the number of users in your area.

Would you like me to check your area's typical congestion patterns?"

Would you like to add a backup card?
150,network_coverage,Does using a phone case affect signal strength?,neutral,"Most modern phone cases have minimal effect on signal strength. However, metal cases or very thick materials can slightly reduce signal. If you're experiencing signal issues, try removing the case temporarily to test. For most users, standard cases don't cause noticeable signal differences. Would you like to test your signal with and without the case?"
